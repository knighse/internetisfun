			<h1> How to stay safe on the Internet!</h1>
			<p> The Internet is a great source of information on an endless amount of topics! Be careful though, because it can be dangerous if you aren't careful! To stay safe, avoid weird looking websites, don't click on ads, be very careful around people you don't know (it's best to stay away from strangers), never give out personal details, and only run files you trust. Now that you know how to stay safe, take the quiz to prove that you can be careful on the Internet.
