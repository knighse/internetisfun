			<h1> How to stay safe on the Internet!</h1>
			<p> The Internet is a great source of information on an endless amount of topics! Be careful though, because it can be dangerous if you aren't careful! To stay safe, avoid weird looking websites, don't click on ads, watch out for strangers (stranger danger, even online), never give out personal details, and make sure the information you get is true. Now that you know how to stay safe, take the quiz to prove that you can be careful on the Internet.
